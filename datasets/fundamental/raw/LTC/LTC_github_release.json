Release\r\n==============\r\n\r\nFollow our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/litecoinproject) for the latest dev news.\r\n\r\nWe are pleased to release Litecoin Core 0.21.2. This is a new major version release, including new features, various bugfixes and performance improvements, as well as updated translations. This update includes full node, wallet and mining support for MWEB. It is recommended for all users to upgrade to this version.\r\n\r\nHow to upgrade: \r\n==============\r\n\r\nFirstly, thank you for running Litecoin Core and helping secure the network!\r\n\r\nAs you\u2019re running an older version of Litecoin Core, shut it down. Wait until it\u2019s completely shut down  - which might take a few minutes for older versions - then follow these simple steps:\r\nFor Windows: simply run the installer \r\nFor Mac: copy over to `/Applications/Litecoin-Qt` \r\nFor Linux: copy cover `litecoind`/`litecoin-qt`.\r\n\r\nNB: upgrading directly from an \u2018end of life\u2019 version of Litecoin Core is possible, but it might take a while if the data directory needs to be migrated. Old wallet versions of Litecoin Core are generally supported.\r\n \r\n\r\nCompatibility:\r\n==============\r\n\r\nLitecoin Core is supported and extensively tested on operating systems using the Linux kernel, macOS 10.10+,  Windows 7 and newer. It\u2019s not recommended to use Litecoin Core on unsupported systems.\r\n\r\nLitecoin Core should also work on most other Unix-like systems, but is not as frequently tested on them.\r\n\r\nMWEB fields added to BlockIndex, and block serialization format has changed. Downgrading to older versions is unsafe.\r\n\r\nIf upgrading to 0.21.2 *after* MWEB has activated, you must resync to download MWEB blocks.\r\n\r\nNotable changes\r\n===============\r\n\r\nConsensus changes\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\n- This release implements the proposed MWEB consensus rules\r\n  ([LIP002](https://github.com/litecoin-project/lips/blob/master/lip-0002.mediawiki),\r\n  [LIP003](https://github.com/litecoin-project/lips/blob/master/lip-0003.mediawiki), and\r\n  [LIP004](https://github.com/litecoin-project/lips/blob/master/lip-0004.mediawiki))\r\n\r\nP2P and network changes\r\n-----------------------\r\n\r\n- A new service flag, NODE_MWEB (1 << 24), was added to signal to peers that the node supports MWEB.\r\n  When connected peers both advertise this capability, they are expected to provide all MWEB data when\r\n  sharing transactions, blocks, and compact blocks with each other.\r\n\r\n- Nodes now announce compact block version 3 support, informing peers that they can provide MWEB data\r\n  in compact blocks.\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdated RPCs\r\n------------\r\n\r\n- `getblockheader` now returns an additional `mweb_header` field containing\r\n  all of the MWEB header data, and an `mweb_amount` field containing the total\r\n  number of coins pegged-in to the MWEB after applying the block.\r\n\r\n- `getblock` now returns an additional `mweb` field containing MWEB header info,\r\n  and all of the inputs, outputs, and kernels in the MWEB block.\r\n\r\n- Added `mwebweight`, `descendantmwebweight`, `ancestormwebweight`, and `mweb`\r\n  fields to `getrawmempool`, `getmempoolancestors`, `getmempooldescendants`,\r\n  and `getmempoolentry`.\r\n\r\n- Added new fields to describe MWEB transaction inputs, outputs, and kernels\r\n  for `getrawtransaction`.\r\n\r\nChanges to Wallet or GUI related RPCs can be found in the GUI or Wallet section below.\r\n\r\nNew settings\r\n------------\r\n\r\n- Added \"fMWEBFeatures\" option for enabling the new \"Advanced MWEB Features\"\r\n  control.\r\n\r\nWallet Database\r\n---------------\r\n\r\n- Added \"mweb_coin\" type which stores MWEB coins and their derived keys.\r\n\r\n- Added CHDChain version 4 which includes an MWEB key index counter and\r\n  the stealth address scan key.\r\n\r\n- Added CKeyMetadata version 14 which includes the MWEB key index.\r\n\r\n- Added FEATURE_MWEB = 210000 minimum database version.\r\n\r\nWallet RPC changes\r\n------------------\r\n\r\n- Added 'listwallettransactions' which matches the transaction list display values.\r\n\r\nGUI changes\r\n-----------\r\n\r\n- Added an \"Advanced MWEB Features\" control for testing. It\u2019s only available\r\n  when the \"-debug\" argument is supplied, and the option is turned on in the\r\n  settings dialog.\r\n\r\nDownload Binaries\r\n=======\r\n\r\nTo download, please visit the download page [here](https://litecoin.org/). Alternatively, you can view the download folder [here](https://download.litecoin.org/litecoin-0.21.2/).\r\n\r\nPlease use GPG to verify the integrity of the release binaries.

Core v0.18.1 Release\r\n\r\n*Follow our\u00a0*[*Twitter*](https://twitter.com/litecoinproject)*\u00a0for the latest dev news.*\r\n\r\nWe are pleased to release Litecoin Core 0.18.1. This is a new major version release, including new features, various bugfixes and performance improvements, as well as updated translations. It is recommended for all users to upgrade to this version.\r\n\r\nHow to Upgrade\r\n==============\r\n\r\nIf you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the installer (on Windows) or just copy over\u00a0`/Applications/Litecoin-Qt`\u00a0(on Mac) or\u00a0`litecoind`/`litecoin-qt`\u00a0(on Linux).\r\n\r\nThe first time you run version 0.15.0 or newer, your chainstate database will be converted to a new format, which will take anywhere from a few minutes to half an hour, depending on the speed of your machine.\r\n\r\nNote that the block database format also changed in version 0.8.0 and there is no automatic upgrade code from before version 0.8 to version 0.15.0 or later. Upgrading directly from 0.7.x and earlier without redownloading the blockchain is not supported. However, as usual, old wallet versions are still supported.\r\n\r\nCompatibility\r\n=============\r\n\r\nLitecoin Core is supported and extensively tested on operating systems using the Linux kernel, macOS 10.10+, and Windows 7 and newer. It is not recommended to use Litecoin Core on unsupported systems.\r\n\r\nLitecoin Core should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not as frequently tested on them.\r\n\r\nFrom 0.17.0 onwards, macOS <10.10 is no longer supported. 0.17.0 is built using Qt 5.9.x, which doesn't support versions of macOS older than 10.10. Additionally, Litecoin Core does not yet change appearance when macOS \"dark mode\" is activated.\r\n\r\nIn addition to previously-supported CPU platforms, this release's pre-compiled distribution also provides binaries for the RISC-V platform.\r\n\r\nKnown issues\r\n============\r\n\r\nWallet GUI\r\n----------\r\n\r\nFor advanced users who have both (1) enabled coin control features, and (2) are using multiple wallets loaded at the same time: The coin control input selection dialog can erroneously retain wrong-wallet state when switching wallets using the dropdown menu. For now, it is recommended not to use coin control features with multiple wallets loaded.\r\n\r\nNotable changes\r\n===============\r\n\r\nMining\r\n------\r\n\r\n-   Calls to\u00a0`getblocktemplate`\u00a0will fail if the segwit rule is not specified. Calling\u00a0`getblocktemplate`\u00a0without segwit specified is almost certainly a misconfiguration since doing so results in lower rewards for the miner. Failed calls will produce an error message describing how to enable the segwit rule.\r\n\r\nConfiguration option changes\r\n----------------------------\r\n\r\n-   A warning is printed if an unrecognized section name is used in the configuration file. Recognized sections are\u00a0`[test]`,\u00a0`[main]`, and\u00a0`[regtest]`.\r\n-   Four new options are available for configuring the maximum number of messages that ZMQ will queue in memory (the \"high water mark\") before dropping additional messages. The default value is 1,000, the same as was used for previous releases. See the\u00a0[ZMQ documentation](https://github.com/litecoin-project/litecoin/blob/master/doc/zmq.md#usage)\u00a0for details.\r\n-   The\u00a0`rpcallowip`\u00a0option can no longer be used to automatically listen on all network interfaces. Instead, the\u00a0`rpcbind`\u00a0parameter must be used to specify the IP addresses to listen on. Listening for RPC commands over a public network connection is insecure and should be disabled, so a warning is now printed if a user selects such a configuration. If you need to expose RPC in order to use a tool like Docker, ensure you only bind RPC to your localhost, e.g.\u00a0`docker run [...] -p 127.0.0.1:9332:9332`\u00a0(this is an extra\u00a0`:9332`\u00a0over the normal Docker port specification).\r\n-   The\u00a0`rpcpassword`\u00a0option now causes a startup error if the password set in the configuration file contains a hash character (#), as it's ambiguous whether the hash character is meant for the password or as a comment.\r\n-   The\u00a0`whitelistforcerelay`\u00a0option is used to relay transactions from whitelisted peers even when not accepted to the mempool. This option now defaults to being off, so that changes in policy and disconnect/ban behavior will not cause a node that is whitelisting another to be dropped by peers. Users can still explicitly enable this behavior with the command line option (and may want to consider\u00a0[contacting](mailto:contact@litecoin.org)\u00a0the Litecoin Core project to let us know about their use-case, as this feature could be deprecated in the future).\r\n\r\nWallet changes\r\n==============\r\n\r\nWhen creating a transaction with a fee above\u00a0`-maxtxfee`\u00a0(default 0.1 LTC), the RPC commands\u00a0`walletcreatefundedpsbt`\u00a0and\u00a0`fundrawtransaction`\u00a0will now fail instead of rounding down the fee. Beware that the\u00a0`feeRate`\u00a0argument is specified in LTC per kilobyte, not litoshi per byte.\r\n\r\nDocumentation\r\n=============\r\n\r\n-   A new short\u00a0[document](https://github.com/litecoin-project/litecoin/blob/master/doc/JSON-RPC-interface.md)\u00a0about the JSON-RPC interface describes cases where the results of an RPC might contain inconsistencies between data sourced from different subsystems, such as wallet state and mempool state. A note is added to the\u00a0[REST interface documentation](https://github.com/litecoin-project/litecoin/blob/master/doc/REST-interface.md)\u00a0indicating that the same rules apply.\r\n-   Further information is added to the\u00a0[JSON-RPC documentation](https://github.com/litecoin-project/litecoin/blob/master/doc/JSON-RPC-interface.md)\u00a0about how to secure this interface.\r\n-   A new\u00a0[document](https://github.com/litecoin-project/litecoin/blob/master/doc/litecoin-conf.md)\u00a0about the\u00a0`litecoin.conf`\u00a0file describes how to use it to configure Litecoin Core.\r\n-   A new document introduces Litecoin Core's BIP174\u00a0[Partially-Signed Litecoin Transactions (PSBT)](https://github.com/litecoin-project/litecoin/blob/master/doc/psbt.md)\u00a0interface, which is used to allow multiple programs to collaboratively work to create, sign, and broadcast new transactions. This is useful for offline (cold storage) wallets, multisig wallets, coinjoin implementations, and many other cases where two or more programs need to interact to generate a complete transaction.\r\n-   The\u00a0[output script descriptor](https://github.com/litecoin-project/litecoin/blob/master/doc/descriptors.md)\u00a0documentation has been updated with information about new features in this still-developing language for describing the output scripts that a wallet or other program wants to receive notifications for, such as which addresses it wants to know received payments. The language is currently used in multiple new and updated RPCs described in these release notes and is expected to be adapted to other RPCs and to the underlying wallet structure.\r\n\r\nBuild system changes\r\n====================\r\n\r\n-   A new\u00a0`--disable-bip70`\u00a0option may be passed to\u00a0`./configure`\u00a0to prevent Litecoin-Qt from being built with support for the BIP70 payment protocol or from linking libssl. As the payment protocol has exposed Litecoin Core to libssl vulnerabilities in the past, builders who don't need BIP70 support are encouraged to use this option to reduce their exposure to future vulnerabilities.\r\n-   The minimum required version of Qt (when building the GUI) has been increased from 5.2 to 5.5.1 (the\u00a0[depends system](https://github.com/litecoin-project/litecoin/blob/master/depends/README.md)\u00a0provides 5.9.7)\r\n\r\nNew RPCs\r\n========\r\n\r\n-   `getnodeaddresses`\u00a0returns peer addresses known to this node. It may be used to find nodes to connect to without using a DNS seeder.\r\n-   `listwalletdir`\u00a0returns a list of wallets in the wallet directory (either the default wallet directory or the directory configured by the\u00a0`-walletdir`\u00a0parameter).\r\n-   `getrpcinfo`\u00a0returns runtime details of the RPC server. At the moment, it returns an array of the currently active commands and how long they've been running.\r\n-   `deriveaddresses`\u00a0returns one or more addresses corresponding to an\u00a0[output descriptor](https://github.com/litecoin-project/litecoin/blob/master/doc/descriptors.md).\r\n-   `getdescriptorinfo`\u00a0accepts a descriptor and returns information about it, including its computed checksum.\r\n-   `joinpsbts`\u00a0merges multiple distinct PSBTs into a single PSBT. The multiple PSBTs must have different inputs. The resulting PSBT will contain every input and output from all of the PSBTs. Any signatures provided in any of the PSBTs will be dropped.\r\n-   `analyzepsbt`\u00a0examines a PSBT and provides information about what the PSBT contains and the next steps that need to be taken in order to complete the transaction. For each input of a PSBT,\u00a0`analyzepsbt`\u00a0provides information about what information is missing for that input, including whether a UTXO needs to be provided, what pubkeys still need to be provided, which scripts need to be provided, and what signatures are still needed. Every input will also list which role is needed to complete that input, and\u00a0`analyzepsbt`\u00a0will also list the next role in general needed to complete the PSBT.\u00a0`analyzepsbt`\u00a0will also provide the estimated fee rate and estimated virtual size of the completed transaction if it has enough information to do so.\r\n-   `utxoupdatepsbt`\u00a0searches the set of Unspent Transaction Outputs (UTXOs) to find the outputs being spent by the partial transaction. PSBTs need to have the UTXOs being spent to be provided because the signing algorithm requires information from the UTXO being spent. For segwit inputs, only the UTXO itself is necessary. For non-segwit outputs, the entire previous transaction is needed so that signers can be sure that they are signing the correct thing. Unfortunately, because the UTXO set only contains UTXOs and not full transactions,\u00a0`utxoupdatepsbt`\u00a0will only add the UTXO for segwit inputs.\r\n\r\nUpdated RPCs\r\n============\r\n\r\nNote: some low-level RPC changes mainly useful for testing are described in the Low-level Changes section below.\r\n\r\n-   `getpeerinfo`\u00a0now returns an additional\u00a0`minfeefilter`\u00a0field set to the peer's BIP133 fee filter. You can use this to detect that you have peers that are willing to accept transactions below the default minimum relay fee.\r\n-   The mempool RPCs, such as\u00a0`getrawmempool`\u00a0with\u00a0`verbose=true`, now return an additional \"bip125-replaceable\" value indicating whether the transaction (or its unconfirmed ancestors) opts-in to asking nodes and miners to replace it with a higher-feerate transaction spending any of the same inputs.\r\n-   `settxfee`\u00a0previously silently ignored attempts to set the fee below the allowed minimums. It now prints a warning. The special value of \"0\" may still be used to request the minimum value.\r\n-   `getaddressinfo`\u00a0now provides an\u00a0`ischange`\u00a0field indicating whether the wallet used the address in a change output.\r\n-   `importmulti`\u00a0has been updated to support P2WSH, P2WPKH, P2SH-P2WPKH, and P2SH-P2WSH. Requests for P2WSH and P2SH-P2WSH accept an additional\u00a0`witnessscript`\u00a0parameter.\r\n-   `importmulti`\u00a0now returns an additional\u00a0`warnings`\u00a0field for each request with an array of strings explaining when fields are being ignored or are inconsistent, if there are any.\r\n-   `getaddressinfo`\u00a0now returns an additional\u00a0`solvable`\u00a0boolean field when Litecoin Core knows enough about the address's scriptPubKey, optional redeemScript, and optional witnessScript in order for the wallet to be able to generate an unsigned input spending funds sent to that address.\r\n-   The\u00a0`getaddressinfo`,\u00a0`listunspent`, and\u00a0`scantxoutset`\u00a0RPCs now return an additional\u00a0`desc`\u00a0field that contains an output descriptor containing all key paths and signing information for the address (except for the private key). The\u00a0`desc`\u00a0field is only returned for\u00a0`getaddressinfo`\u00a0and\u00a0`listunspent`\u00a0when the address is solvable.\r\n-   `importprivkey`\u00a0will preserve previously-set labels for addresses or public keys corresponding to the private key being imported. For example, if you imported a watch-only address with the label \"cold wallet\" in earlier releases of Litecoin Core, subsequently importing the private key would default to resetting the address's label to the default empty-string label (\"\"). In this release, the previous label of \"cold wallet\" will be retained. If you optionally specify any label besides the default when calling\u00a0`importprivkey`, the new label will be applied to the address.\r\n-   See the\u00a0[Mining](https://github.com/litecoin-project/litecoin/blob/v0.18.1rc1/doc/release-notes-litecoin.md#mining)\u00a0section for changes to\u00a0`getblocktemplate`.\r\n-   `getmininginfo`\u00a0now omits\u00a0`currentblockweight`\u00a0and\u00a0`currentblocktx`\u00a0when a block was never assembled via RPC on this node.\r\n-   The\u00a0`getrawtransaction`\u00a0RPC & REST endpoints no longer check the unspent UTXO set for a transaction. The remaining behaviors are as follows: 1. If a blockhash is provided, check the corresponding block. 2. If no blockhash is provided, check the mempool. 3. If no blockhash is provided but txindex is enabled, also check txindex.\r\n-   `unloadwallet`\u00a0is now synchronous, meaning it will not return until the wallet is fully unloaded.\r\n-   `importmulti`\u00a0now supports importing of addresses from descriptors. A \"desc\" parameter can be provided instead of the \"scriptPubKey\" in a request, as well as an optional range for ranged descriptors to specify the start and end of the range to import. Descriptors with key origin information imported through\u00a0`importmulti`\u00a0will have their key origin information stored in the wallet for use with creating PSBTs. More information about descriptors can be found\u00a0[here](https://github.com/litecoin-project/litecoin/blob/master/doc/descriptors.md).\r\n-   `listunspent`\u00a0has been modified so that it also returns\u00a0`witnessScript`, the witness script in the case of a P2WSH or P2SH-P2WSH output.\r\n-   `createwallet`\u00a0now has an optional\u00a0`blank`\u00a0argument that can be used to create a blank wallet. Blank wallets do not have any keys or HD seed. They cannot be opened in software older than 0.18. Once a blank wallet has a HD seed set (by using\u00a0`sethdseed`) or private keys, scripts, addresses, and other watch only things have been imported, the wallet is no longer blank and can be opened in 0.17.x. Encrypting a blank wallet will also set a HD seed for it.\r\n\r\nDeprecated or removed RPCs\r\n==========================\r\n\r\n-   `signrawtransaction`\u00a0is removed after being deprecated and hidden behind a special configuration option in version 0.17.0.\r\n-   The 'account' API is removed after being deprecated in v0.17. The 'label' API was introduced in v0.17 as a replacement for accounts. See the\u00a0[release notes from v0.17](https://github.com/litecoin-project/litecoin/blob/master/doc/release-notes/release-notes-0.17.0.md#label-and-account-apis-for-wallet)\u00a0for a full description of the changes from the 'account' API to the 'label' API.\r\n-   `addwitnessaddress`\u00a0is removed after being deprecated in version 0.16.0.\r\n-   `generate`\u00a0is deprecated and will be fully removed in a subsequent major version. This RPC is only used for testing, but its implementation reached across multiple subsystems (wallet and mining), so it is being deprecated to simplify the wallet-node interface. Projects that are using\u00a0`generate`\u00a0for testing purposes should transition to using the\u00a0`generatetoaddress`\u00a0RPC, which does not require or use the wallet component. Calling\u00a0`generatetoaddress`\u00a0with an address returned by the\u00a0`getnewaddress`\u00a0RPC gives the same functionality as the old\u00a0`generate`\u00a0RPC. To continue using\u00a0`generate`\u00a0in this version, restart litecoind with the\u00a0`-deprecatedrpc=generate`\u00a0configuration option.\r\n-   Be reminded that parts of the\u00a0`validateaddress`\u00a0command have been deprecated and moved to\u00a0`getaddressinfo`. The following deprecated fields have moved to\u00a0`getaddressinfo`:\u00a0`ismine`,\u00a0`iswatchonly`,\u00a0`script`,\u00a0`hex`,\u00a0`pubkeys`,\u00a0`sigsrequired`,\u00a0`pubkey`,\u00a0`embedded`,\u00a0`iscompressed`,\u00a0`label`,\u00a0`timestamp`,\u00a0`hdkeypath`,\u00a0`hdmasterkeyid`.\r\n-   The\u00a0`addresses`\u00a0field has been removed from the\u00a0`validateaddress`\u00a0and\u00a0`getaddressinfo`\u00a0RPC methods. This field was confusing since it referred to public keys using their P2PKH address. Clients should use the\u00a0`embedded.address`\u00a0field for P2SH or P2WSH wrapped addresses, and\u00a0`pubkeys`\u00a0for inspecting multisig participants.\r\n\r\nREST changes\r\n============\r\n\r\n-   A new\u00a0`/rest/blockhashbyheight/`\u00a0endpoint is added for fetching the hash of the block in the current best blockchain based on its height (how many blocks it is after the Genesis Block).\r\n\r\nGraphical User Interface (GUI)\r\n==============================\r\n\r\n-   A new Window menu is added alongside the existing File, Settings, and Help menus. Several items from the other menus that opened new windows have been moved to this new Window menu.\r\n-   In the Send tab, the checkbox for \"pay only the required fee\" has been removed. Instead, the user can simply decrease the value in the Custom Feerate field all the way down to the node's configured minimum relay fee.\r\n-   In the Overview tab, the watch-only balance will be the only balance shown if the wallet was created using the\u00a0`createwallet`\u00a0RPC and the\u00a0`disable_private_keys`\u00a0parameter was set to true.\r\n-   The launch-on-startup option is no longer available on macOS if compiled with macosx min version greater than 10.11 (use CXXFLAGS=\"-mmacosx-version-min=10.11\" CFLAGS=\"-mmacosx-version-min=10.11\" for setting the deployment sdk version)\r\n\r\nTools\r\n=====\r\n\r\n-   A new\u00a0`litecoin-wallet`\u00a0tool is now distributed alongside Litecoin Core's other executables. Without needing to use any RPCs, this tool can currently create a new wallet file or display some basic information about an existing wallet, such as whether the wallet is encrypted, whether it uses an HD seed, how many transactions it contains, and how many address book entries it has.\r\n\r\nPlanned changes\r\n===============\r\n\r\nThis section describes planned changes to Litecoin Core that may affect other Litecoin software and services.\r\n\r\n-   Since version 0.16.0, Litecoin Core's built-in wallet has defaulted to generating P2SH-wrapped segwit addresses when users want to receive payments. These addresses are backwards compatible with all widely-used software. Starting with Litecoin Core 0.20, Litecoin Core will default to native segwit addresses (bech32) that provide additional fee savings and other benefits. Currently, many wallets and services already support sending to bech32 addresses, and if the Litecoin Core project sees enough additional adoption, it will instead default to bech32 receiving addresses in Litecoin Core 0.20. P2SH-wrapped segwit addresses will continue to be provided if the user requests them in the GUI or by RPC, and anyone who doesn't want the update will be able to configure their default address type. (Similarly, pioneering users who want to change their default now may set the\u00a0`addresstype=bech32`\u00a0configuration option in any Litecoin Core release from 0.16.0 up.)\r\n\r\nDeprecated P2P messages\r\n=======================\r\n\r\n-   BIP 61 reject messages are now deprecated. Reject messages have no use case on the P2P network and are only logged for debugging by most network nodes. Furthermore, they increase bandwidth and can be harmful for privacy and security. It has been possible to disable BIP 61 messages since v0.17 with the\u00a0`-enablebip61=0`\u00a0option. BIP 61 messages will be disabled by default in a future version, before being removed entirely.\r\n\r\nLow-level changes\r\n=================\r\n\r\nThis section describes RPC changes mainly useful for testing, mostly not relevant in production. The changes are mentioned for completeness.\r\n\r\nRPC\r\n===\r\n\r\n-   The\u00a0`submitblock`\u00a0RPC previously returned the reason a rejected block was invalid the first time it processed that block, but returned a generic \"duplicate\" rejection message on subsequent occasions it processed the same block. It now always returns the fundamental reason for rejecting an invalid block and only returns \"duplicate\" for valid blocks it has already accepted.\r\n-   A new\u00a0`submitheader`\u00a0RPC allows submitting block headers independently from their block. This is likely only useful for testing.\r\n-   The\u00a0`signrawtransactionwithkey`\u00a0and\u00a0`signrawtransactionwithwallet`\u00a0RPCs have been modified so that they also optionally accept a\u00a0`witnessScript`, the witness script in the case of a P2WSH or P2SH-P2WSH output. This is compatible with the change to\u00a0`listunspent`.\r\n-   For the\u00a0`walletprocesspsbt`\u00a0and\u00a0`walletcreatefundedpsbt`\u00a0RPCs, if the\u00a0`bip32derivs`\u00a0parameter is set to true but the key metadata for a public key has not been updated yet, then that key will have a derivation path as if it were just an independent key (i.e. no derivation path and its master fingerprint is itself).\r\n\r\nConfiguration\r\n=============\r\n\r\n-   The\u00a0`-usehd`\u00a0configuration option was removed in version 0.16. From that version onwards, all new wallets created are hierarchical deterministic wallets. This release makes specifying\u00a0`-usehd`\u00a0an invalid configuration option.\r\n\r\nNetwork\r\n=======\r\n\r\n-   This release allows peers that your node automatically disconnected for misbehavior (e.g. sending invalid data) to reconnect to your node if you have unused incoming connection slots. If your slots fill up, a misbehaving node will be disconnected to make room for nodes without a history of problems (unless the misbehaving node helps your node in some other way, such as by connecting to a part of the Internet from which you don't have many other peers). Previously, Litecoin Core banned the IP addresses of misbehaving peers for a period of time (default of 1 day); this was easily circumvented by attackers with multiple IP addresses. If you manually ban a peer, such as by using the\u00a0`setban`\u00a0RPC, all connections from that peer will still be rejected.\r\n\r\nWallet\r\n======\r\n\r\n-   The key metadata will need to be upgraded the first time that the HD seed is available. For unencrypted wallets this will occur on wallet loading. For encrypted wallets this will occur the first time the wallet is unlocked.\r\n-   Newly encrypted wallets will no longer require restarting the software. Instead such wallets will be completely unloaded and reloaded to achieve the same effect.\r\n-   A sub-project of Litecoin Core now provides Hardware Wallet Interaction (HWI) scripts that allow command-line users to use several popular hardware key management devices with Litecoin Core. See their\u00a0[project page](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/HWI#readme)\u00a0for details.\r\n\r\nSecurity\r\n========\r\n\r\n-   This release changes the Random Number Generator (RNG) used from OpenSSL to Litecoin Core's own implementation, although entropy gathered by Litecoin Core is fed out to OpenSSL and then read back in when the program needs strong randomness. This moves Litecoin Core a little closer to no longer needing to depend on OpenSSL, a dependency that has caused security issues in the past. The new implementation gathers entropy from multiple sources, including from hardware supporting the rdseed CPU instruction.\r\n\r\nChanges for particular platforms\r\n================================\r\n\r\n-   On macOS, Litecoin Core now opts out of application CPU throttling (\"app nap\") during initial blockchain download, when catching up from over 100 blocks behind the current chain tip, or when reindexing chain data. This helps prevent these operations from taking an excessively long time because the operating system is attempting to conserve power.\r\n\r\nDownload Binaries\r\n=================\r\n\r\nTo download, please visit the download page\u00a0[here](https://litecoin.org/). Alternatively, you can view the download folder\u00a0[here](https://download.litecoin.org/litecoin-0.18.1/).\r\n\r\nPlease use GPG to verify the integrity of the release binaries. This ensures that the binary you have downloaded has not been tampered with. Linux, MacOS and Win32 cygwin command line GPG instructions are available\u00a0[here](https://download.litecoin.org/README-HOWTO-GPG-VERIFY-TEAM-MEMBERS-KEY.txt). Please also note that we GPG sign the binaries as a convenience to you, the ultimate way to verify the integrity of the builds is to build them yourself using Gitian. Instructions on how to perform these builds, can be found\u00a0[here](https://github.com/litecoin-project/litecoin/blob/master/doc/gitian-building.md).\r\n\r\nFor this release, the binaries have been signed with key identifier\u00a0[FE3348877809386C\u00a0](https://pgp.mit.edu/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0xFE3348877809386C)(thrasher's key).\r\n\r\nWARNING\r\n=======\r\n\r\nDespite this version being heavily tested, this version may still contain bugs.

This is a new major version\r\nrelease, including new features, various bugfixes and performance improvements,\r\nas well as updated translations. It is recommended for all users to upgrade to\r\nthis version.\r\n\r\n### How to Upgrade\r\n\r\nIf you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely\r\nshut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the\r\ninstaller (on Windows) or just copy over `/Applications/Litecoin-Qt` (on Mac) or\r\n`litecoind`/`litecoin-qt` (on Linux).\r\n\r\nIf your node has a txindex, the txindex db will be migrated the first time you\r\nrun 0.17.1 or newer, which may take up to a few hours. Your node will not be\r\nfunctional until this migration completes.\r\n\r\nThe first time you run version 0.15.0 or newer, your chainstate database will be\r\nconverted to a new format. This will take anywhere from a few minutes to half an\r\nhour depending on the speed of your machine.\r\n\r\nNote that the block database format also changed in version 0.8.0 and there is\r\nno automatic upgrade code from before version 0.8 to version 0.15.0. Upgrading\r\ndirectly from 0.7.x and earlier without redownloading the blockchain is not\r\nsupported. However, as usual, old wallet versions are still supported.\r\n\r\n### Downgrading warning\r\n\r\nThe chainstate database for this release is not compatible with previous\r\nreleases, so if you run 0.15 and then decide to switch back to any older\r\nversion, you will need to run the old release with the\r\n`-reindex-chainstate`option to rebuild the chainstate data structures in the old\r\nformat.\r\n\r\nIf your node has pruning enabled, this will entail re-downloading and processing\r\nthe entire blockchain.\r\n\r\n### Compatibility\r\n\r\nLitecoin Core is extensively tested on multiple operating systems using the\r\nLinux kernel, macOS 10.10+, and Windows 7 and newer (Windows XP is not\r\nsupported).\r\n\r\nLitecoin Core should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not\r\nfrequently tested on them.\r\n\r\nFrom 0.17.1 onwards macOS <10.10 is no longer supported. 0.17.1 is built using\r\nQt 5.9.x, which doesn\u2019t support versions of macOS older than 10.10.\r\n\r\n#### Known issues\r\n\r\n* Upgrading from 0.13.2 or older currently results in memory blow-up during the\r\nroll-back of blocks to the SegWit activation point. In these cases, a full\r\n`-reindex` is necessary.\r\n* The GUI suffers from visual glitches in the new MacOS dark mode. This has to do\r\nwith our Qt theme handling impacting older versions of Litecoin Core, but is\r\nexpected to be resolved in 0.17.1.\r\n\r\n### `listtransactions` label support\r\n\r\nThe `listtransactions` RPC `account` parameter has been renamed to `label`.\r\n\r\nWhen litecoin is configured with the `-deprecatedrpc=accounts` setting,\r\nspecifying a label/account/dummy argument will return both outgoing and incoming\r\ntransactions. Without the `-deprecatedrpc=accounts` setting, it will only return\r\nincoming transactions (because it used to be possible to create transactions\r\nspending from specific accounts, but this is no longer possiblewith labels).\r\n\r\nWhen `-deprecatedrpc=accounts` is set, it's possible to pass the empty string \"\"\r\nto list transactions that don't have any label. Without\r\n`-deprecatedrpc=accounts`, passing the empty string is an error because\r\nreturning only non-labeled transactions is not generally useful behavior and can\r\ncause confusion.\r\n\r\n### Changed configuration options\r\n\r\n* `-includeconf=<file>` can be used to include additional configuration files.\r\nOnly works inside the `litecoin.conf` file, not inside included files or from\r\ncommand-line. Multiple files may be included. Can be disabled from command- line\r\nvia `-noincludeconf`. Note that multi-argument commands like `-includeconf` will\r\noverride preceding `-noincludeconf`, i.e.\r\n\r\n    noincludeconf=1\r\n    includeconf=relative.conf\r\n\r\nas litecoin.conf will still include `relative.conf`.\r\n\r\n### GUI changes\r\n\r\n* Block storage can be limited under Preferences, in the Main tab. Undoing this\r\nsetting requires downloading the full blockchain again. This mode is\r\nincompatible with -txindex and -rescan.\r\n\r\n### External wallet files\r\n\r\nThe `-wallet=<path>` option now accepts full paths instead of requiring wallets\r\nto be located in the -walletdir directory.\r\n\r\n### Newly created wallet format\r\n\r\nIf `-wallet=<path>` is specified with a path that does not exist, it will now\r\ncreate a wallet directory at the specified location (containing a wallet.dat\r\ndata file, a db.log file, and database/log.?????????? files) instead of just\r\ncreating a data file at the path and storing log files in the parent directory.\r\nThis should make backing up wallets more straightforward than before because the\r\nspecified wallet path can just be directly archived without having to look in\r\nthe parent directory for transaction log files.\r\n\r\nFor backwards compatibility, wallet paths that are names of existing data files\r\nin the `-walletdir` directory will continue to be accepted and interpreted the\r\nsame as before.\r\n\r\n### Dynamic loading and creation of wallets\r\n\r\nPreviously, wallets could only be loaded or created at startup, by specifying\r\n`-wallet` parameters on the command line or in the litecoin.conf file. It is now\r\npossible to load, create and unload wallets dynamically at runtime:\r\n\r\n* Existing wallets can be loaded by calling the `loadwallet` RPC. The wallet can\r\nbe specified as file/directory basename (which must be located in the\r\n`walletdir` directory), or as an absolute path to a file/directory.\r\n* New wallets can be created (and loaded) by calling the `createwallet` RPC. The\r\nprovided name must not match a wallet file in the `walletdir`directory or the\r\nname of a wallet that is currently loaded.\r\n* Loaded wallets can be unloaded by calling the `unloadwallet` RPC.\r\n\r\nThis feature is currently only available through the RPC interface.\r\n\r\n### Coin selection\r\n\r\n#### Partial spend avoidance\r\n\r\nWhen an address is paid multiple times the coins from those separate payments\r\ncan be spent separately which hurts privacy due to linking otherwise separate\r\naddresses. A new `-avoidpartialspends` flag has been added (default=false). If\r\nenabled, the wallet will always spend existing UTXO to the same address together\r\neven if it results in higher fees. If someone were to send coins to an address\r\nafter it was used, those coins will still be included in future coin selections.\r\n\r\n### Fee policy changes\r\n\r\nThe default minimum transaction fee `-mintxfee` has been lowered to 0.0001\r\nLTC/kB after relaxing the minimum relay and dust relay fee rates in prior\r\nreleases.\r\n\r\n### Configuration sections for testnet and regtest\r\n\r\nIt is now possible for a single configuration file to set different options for\r\ndifferent networks. This is done by using sections or by prefixing the option\r\nwith the network, such as:\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the following options are not in a section, they will only apply to mainnet:\r\n`addnode=`, `connect=`, `port=`, `bind=`, `rpcport=`, `rpcbind=` and `wallet=`.\r\nThe options to choose a network (`regtest=` and `testnet=`) must be specified\r\noutside of sections.\r\n\r\n### \u2018label\u2019 and \u2018account\u2019 APIs for wallet\r\n\r\nA new \u2018label\u2019 API has been introduced for the wallet. This is intended as a\r\nreplacement for the deprecated \u2018account\u2019 API. The \u2018account\u2019 can continue to be\r\nused in V0.17 by starting litecoind with the \u2018-deprecatedrpc=accounts\u2019 argument,\r\nand will be fully removed in V0.18.\r\n\r\nThe label RPC methods mirror the account functionality, with the following\r\nfunctional differences:\r\n\r\n* Labels can be set on any address, not just receiving addresses. This\r\nfunctionality was previously only available through the GUI.\r\n* Labels can be deleted by reassigning all addresses using the `setlabel` RPC\r\nmethod.\r\n* There isn\u2019t support for sending transactions *from* a label, or for determining\r\nwhich label a transaction was sent from.\r\n* Labels do not have a balance.\r\n\r\nHere are the changes to RPC methods:\r\n\r\n### BIP 174 Partially Signed Litecoin Transactions support\r\n\r\n[BIP 174 PSBT](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0174.mediawiki)\r\nis an interchange format for Litecoin transactions that are not fully signed\r\nyet, together with relevant metadata to help entities work towards signing it.\r\nIt is intended to simplify workflows where multiple parties need to cooperate to\r\nproduce a transaction. Examples include hardware wallets, multisig setups, and\r\n[CoinJoin](https://bitcointalk.org/?topic=279249) transactions.\r\n\r\nFor backend RPC convenience, the Litecoin devs have supported to keep the\r\nacronym `PSBT` instead of `PSLT` to make crosschain application support easier.\r\n\r\n### Overall workflow\r\n\r\nOverall, the construction of a fully signed Litecoin transaction goes through\r\nthe following steps:\r\n\r\n* A Creator proposes a particular transaction to be created. He constructs a PSBT\r\nthat contains certain inputs and outputs, but no additional metadata.\r\n* For each input, an Updater adds information about the UTXOs being spent by the\r\ntransaction to the PSBT.\r\n* A potentially other Updater adds information about the scripts and public keys\r\ninvolved in each of the inputs (and possibly outputs) of the PSBT.\r\n* Signers inspect the transaction and its metadata to decide whether they agree\r\nwith the transaction. They can use amount information from the UTXOs to assess\r\nthe values and fees involved. If they agree, they produce a partial signature\r\nfor the inputs for which they have relevant key(s).\r\n* A Finalizer is run for each input to convert the partial signatures and possibly\r\nscript information into a final `scriptSig` and/or `scriptWitness`.\r\n* An Extractor produces a valid Litecoin transaction (in network format) from a\r\nPSBT for which all inputs are finalized.\r\n\r\nGenerally, each of the above (excluding Creator and Extractor) will simply add\r\nmore and more data to a particular PSBT. In a naive workflow, they all have to\r\noperate sequentially, passing the PSBT from one to the next, until the Extractor\r\ncan convert it to a real transaction. In order to permit parallel operation,\r\nCombiners can be employed which merge metadata from different PSBTs for the same\r\nunsigned transaction.\r\n\r\nThe names above in bold are the names of the roles defined in BIP174. They\u2019re\r\nuseful in understanding the underlying steps, but in practice, software and\r\nhardware implementations will typically implement multiple roles simultaneously.\r\n\r\n### RPCs\r\n\r\n* `converttopsbt` (Creator) is a utility RPC that converts an unsigned raw\r\ntransaction to PSBT format. It ignores existing signatures.\r\n* `createpsbt` (Creator) is a utility RPC that takes a list of inputs and outputs\r\nand converts them to a PSBT with no additional information. It is equivalent to\r\ncalling `createrawtransaction` followed by `converttopsbt`.\r\n* `walletcreatefundedpsbt` (Creator, Updater) is a wallet RPC that creates a PSBT\r\nwith the specified inputs and outputs, adds additional inputs and change to it\r\nto balance it out, and adds relevant metadata. In particular, for inputs that\r\nthe wallet knows about (counting towards its normal or watch-only balance), UTXO\r\ninformation will be added. For outputs and inputs with UTXO information present,\r\nkey and script information will be added which the wallet knows about. It is\r\nequivalent to running `createrawtransaction`, followed by `fundrawtransaction`,\r\nand `converttopsbt`.\r\n* `walletprocesspsbt` (Updater, Signer, Finalizer) is a wallet RPC that takes as\r\ninput a PSBT, adds UTXO, key, and script data to inputs and outputs that miss\r\nit, and optionally signs inputs. Where possible it also finalizes the partial\r\nsignatures.\r\n* `finalizepsbt` (Finalizer, Extractor) is a utility RPC that finalizes any\r\npartial signatures, and if all inputs are finalized, converts the result to a\r\nfully signed transaction which can be broadcast with `sendrawtransaction`.\r\n* `combinepsbt` (Combiner) is a utility RPC that implements a Combiner. It can be\r\nused at any point in the workflow to merge information added to different\r\nversions of the same PSBT. In particular it is useful to combine the output of\r\nmultiple Updaters or Signers.\r\n* `decodepsbt` is a diagnostic utility RPC which will show all information in a\r\nPSBT in human-readable form, as well as compute its eventual fee if known.\r\n\r\n### Upgrading non-HD wallets to HD wallets\r\n\r\nSince Litecoin Core 0.13.2, creating new BIP 32 Hierarchical Deterministic\r\nwallets has been supported by Litecoin Core but old non-HD wallets could not be\r\nupgraded to HD. Now non-HD wallets can be upgraded to HD using the\r\n`-upgradewallet` command line option. This upgrade will result in the all keys\r\nin the keypool being marked as used and a new keypool generated. A new backup\r\nmust be made when this upgrade is performed.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, `-upgradewallet` can be used to upgraded from a non-split HD chain\r\n(all keys generated with `m/0'/0'/i'`) to a split HD chain (receiving keys\r\ngenerated with `'m/0'/0'/i'` and change keys generated with `m'/0'/1'/i'`). When\r\nthis upgrade occurs, all keys already in the keypool will remain in the keypool\r\nto be used until all keys from before the upgrade are exhausted. This is to\r\navoid issues with backups and downgrades when some keys may come from the change\r\nkey keypool. Users can begin using the new split HD chain keypools by using the\r\n`newkeypool` RPC to mark all keys in the keypool as used and begin using a new\r\nkeypool generated from the split HD chain.\r\n\r\n### HD Master key rotation\r\n\r\nA new RPC, `sethdseed`, has been introduced which allows users to set a new HD\r\nseed or set their own HD seed. This allows for a new HD seed to be used. A new\r\nbackup must be made when a new HD seed is set.\r\n\r\n### Low-level RPC changes\r\n\r\n* The new RPC `scantxoutset` can be used to scan the UTXO set for entries that\r\nmatch certain output descriptors. Refer to the [output descriptors reference\r\ndocumentation](https://github.com/litecoin-project/litecoin/blob/master/doc/descriptors.md)\r\nfor more details. This call is similar to `listunspent` but does not use a\r\nwallet, meaning that the wallet can be disabled at compile or run time. This\r\ncall is experimental, as such, is subject to changes or removal in future\r\nreleases.\r\n* The `createrawtransaction` RPC will now accept an array or dictionary (kept for\r\ncompatibility) for the `outputs` parameter. This means the order of transaction\r\noutputs can be specified by the client.\r\n* The `fundrawtransaction` RPC will reject the previously deprecated\r\n`reserveChangeKey` option.\r\n* `sendmany` now shuffles outputs to improve privacy, so any previously expected\r\nbehavior with regards to output ordering can no longer be relied upon.\r\n* The new RPC `testmempoolaccept` can be used to test acceptance of a transaction\r\nto the mempool without adding it.\r\n* JSON transaction decomposition now includes a `weight` field which provides the\r\ntransaction's exact weight. This is included in REST /rest/tx/ and /rest/block/\r\nendpoints when in json mode. This is also included in `getblock` (with\r\nverbosity=2), `listsinceblock`, `listtransactions`, and `getrawtransaction` RPC\r\ncommands.\r\n* New `fees` field introduced in `getrawmempool`, `getmempoolancestors`,\r\n`getmempooldescendants` and `getmempoolentry` when verbosity is set to `true`\r\nwith sub-fields `ancestor`, `base`, `modified` and `descendant`denominated in\r\nLTC. This new field deprecates previous fee fields, such as `fee`,\r\n`modifiedfee`, `ancestorfee` and `descendantfee`.\r\n* The new RPC `getzmqnotifications` returns information about active ZMQ\r\nnotifications.\r\n* When litecoin is not started with any `-wallet=<path>` options, the name of the\r\ndefault wallet returned by `getwalletinfo` and `listwallets` RPCs is now the\r\nempty string `\"\"` instead of `\"wallet.dat\"`. If litecoin is started with any\r\n`-wallet=<path>` options, there is no change in behavior, and the name of any\r\nwallet is just its `<path>` string.\r\n* Passing an empty string (`\"\"`) as the `address_type` parameter to\r\n`getnewaddress`, `getrawchangeaddress`, `addmultisigaddress`,\r\n`fundrawtransaction` RPCs is now an error. Previously, this would fall back to\r\nusing the default address type. It is still possible to pass null or leave the\r\nparameter unset to use the default address type.\r\n* Bare multisig outputs to our keys are no longer automatically treated as\r\nincoming payments. As this feature was only available for multisig outputs for\r\nwhich you had all private keys in your wallet, there was generally no use for\r\nthem compared to single-key schemes. Furthermore, no address format for such\r\noutputs is defined, and wallet software can\u2019t easily send to it. These outputs\r\nwill no longer show up in `listtransactions`, `listunspent`, or contribute to\r\nyour balance, unless they are explicitly watched (using `importaddress` or\r\n`importmulti` with hex script argument). `signrawtransaction*` also still works\r\nfor them.\r\n* The `getwalletinfo` RPC method now returns an `hdseedid` value, which is always\r\nthe same as the incorrectly-named `hdmasterkeyid` value. `hdmasterkeyid` will be\r\nremoved in V0.18.\r\n* The `getaddressinfo` RPC method now returns an `hdseedid` value, which is always\r\nthe same as the incorrectly-named `hdmasterkeyid` value. `hdmasterkeyid` will be\r\nremoved in V0.18.\r\n* Parts of the `validateaddress` RPC method have been deprecated and moved to\r\n`getaddressinfo`. Clients must transition to using `getaddressinfo` to access\r\nthis information before upgrading to v0.18. The following deprecated fields have\r\nmoved to `getaddressinfo` and will only be shown with\r\n`-deprecatedrpc=validateaddress`: `ismine`, `iswatchonly`, `script`, `hex`,\r\n`pubkeys`, `sigsrequired`, `pubkey`, `addresses`, `embedded`, `iscompressed`,\r\n`account`, `timestamp`, `hdkeypath`, `hdmasterkeyid`.\r\n* `signrawtransaction` is deprecated and will be fully removed in v0.18. To use\r\n`signrawtransaction` in v0.17, restart litecoind with\r\n`-deprecatedrpc=signrawtransaction`. Projects should transition to using\r\n`signrawtransactionwithkey` and `signrawtransactionwithwallet` before upgrading\r\nto v0.18.\r\n\r\n### Other API changes\r\n\r\n* The `inactivehdmaster` property in the `dumpwallet` output has been corrected to\r\n`inactivehdseed`\r\n\r\n### Logging\r\n\r\n* The log timestamp format is now ISO 8601 (e.g. \u201c2018\u201302\u201328T12:34:56Z\u201d).\r\n* When running litecoind with `-debug` but without `-daemon`, logging to stdout is\r\nnow the default behavior. Setting `-printtoconsole=1` no longer implicitly\r\ndisables logging to debug.log. Instead, logging to file can be explicitly\r\ndisabled by setting `-debuglogfile=0`.\r\n\r\n### Transaction index changes\r\n\r\nThe transaction index is now built separately from the main node procedure,\r\nmeaning the `-txindex` flag can be toggled without a full reindex. If litecoind\r\nis run with `-txindex` on a node that is already partially or fully synced\r\nwithout one, the transaction index will be built in the background and become\r\navailable once caught up. When switching from running `-txindex` to running\r\nwithout the flag, the transaction index database will *not* be deleted\r\nautomatically, meaning it could be turned back on at a later time without a full\r\nresync.\r\n\r\n### Miner block size removed\r\n\r\nThe `-blockmaxsize` option for miners to limit their blocks' sizes was\r\ndeprecated in V0.15.1, and has now been removed. Miners should use the\r\n`-blockmaxweight` option if they want to limit the weight of their blocks.\r\n\r\n### Python Support\r\n\r\nSupport for Python 2 has been discontinued for all test files and tools.\r\n\r\n### Download Binaries\r\n\r\nTo download, please visit the download page [here](https://www.litecoin.org/).\r\nAlternatively, you can view the download folder\r\n[here](https://download.litecoin.org/litecoin-0.17.1/).\r\n\r\nPlease use GPG to verify the integrity of the release binaries.

Wait until it has completely\r\nshut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the\r\ninstaller (on Windows) or just copy over `/Applications/Litecoin-Qt` (on Mac)\r\nor `litecoind`/`litecoin-qt` (on Linux).\r\n\r\nThe first time you run version 0.15.0 or newer, your chainstate database will be converted to a\r\nnew format, which will take anywhere from a few minutes to half an hour,\r\ndepending on the speed of your machine.\r\n\r\nNote that the block database format also changed in version 0.8.0 and there is no\r\nautomatic upgrade code from before version 0.8 to version 0.15.0 or higher. Upgrading\r\ndirectly from 0.7.x and earlier without re-downloading the blockchain is not supported.\r\nHowever, as usual, old wallet versions are still supported.\r\n\r\nDowngrading warning\r\n-------------------\r\n\r\nWallets created in 0.16 and later are not compatible with versions prior to 0.16\r\nand will not work if you try to use newly created wallets in older versions. Existing\r\nwallets that were created with older versions are not affected by this.\r\n\r\nCompatibility\r\n==============\r\n\r\nLitecoin Core is extensively tested on multiple operating systems using\r\nthe Linux kernel, macOS 10.8+, and Windows Vista and later. Windows XP is not supported.\r\n\r\nLitecoin Core should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not\r\nfrequently tested on them.\r\n\r\nNotable changes\r\n===============\r\n\r\nDenial-of-Service vulnerability\r\n-------------------------------\r\n\r\nA denial-of-service vulnerability exploitable by miners has been discovered in\r\nLitecoin Core versions 0.14.0 up to 0.16.2. It is recommended to upgrade any of\r\nthe vulnerable versions to 0.16.3 as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n0.16.3 change log\r\n------------------\r\n\r\n### Consensus\r\n- #14249 `696b936` Fix crash bug
