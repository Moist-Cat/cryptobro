# Cryptobro

In this project, we analyse the behaviour of several financial assets and comodities and provide bounds for the price based on several assumptions.

# Quick guide

Install the requirements at `requirements.txt` and use `streamlit run main.py` to experiment with the data at `datasets/`.

The folder `report/` contains a pdf with the details of the implementation and the results.
